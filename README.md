# Automotive Predictive Maintenance System

A production-grade machine learning system for predicting component failures 
and estimating Remaining Useful Life (RUL) from automotive telematics data.

This project simulates real-world BMW use cases such as:
- Battery health forecasting
- Brake system degradation prediction
- Engine vibration anomaly detection
- Remaining Useful Life (RUL) estimation
- Real-time telemetry monitoring & alerting

## 🚗 Key Features
- Time-series deep learning models (LSTM, GRU)
- Baseline classical models (XGBoost)
- Full ML pipeline: preprocessing → feature extraction → modeling
- MLflow tracking and experiment management
- FastAPI deployment for real-time inference
- Dockerized API and training environment
- Streamlit dashboard for live visualization
- Anomaly detection & alert system

## 📂 Repository Structure
See `docs/architecture.png` for pipeline design.
